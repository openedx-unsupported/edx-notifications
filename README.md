========================

This is the development repository for the Open edX Notification subsystem. This repository is a work in progress.



Developer's Documentation
-------------

Please see the github repository for [developer's documentation](https://github.com/edx/edx-notifications/wiki)


Standalone Testing
------------------

Please always run tests before committing code back to origin. It is required that all contributions have 100% (or close)
unit test coverage and no code convention violations (pep8/pylint).

        $ ./run_tests


Open edX Platform Integration
-----------------------------
* Add desired commit hash (tip of master) from github code repository
    * edx-platform/requirements/github.txt
    * "Our libraries" section

* Add required configuration in your settings file, e.g. common.py:

```

# add to the INSTALLED_APPS list
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    :
    'edx_notifications',
    'edx_notifications.server.web',
    :
)

# make sure that 'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader' is
# in the list of TEMPLATE_LOADERS
TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
    :
    'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
    :
)

# for now we just support SQL backed stores
NOTIFICATION_STORE_PROVIDER = {
    "class": "edx_notifications.stores.sql.store_provider.SQLNotificationStoreProvider",
    "options": {
    }
}

# This setting already exists in the LMS, please
# update it
SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
    'djcelery': 'ignore',
    'edx_notifications': 'edx_notifications.stores.sql.migrations',
}

# to prevent run-away queries from happening
MAX_NOTIFICATION_LIST_SIZE = 100

# a mapping table which is used by the MsgTypeToUrlLinkResolver
# to map a notification type to a statically defined URL path
NOTIFICATION_CLICK_LINK_URL_MAPS = {
    # To serve as a test exampe this will convert
    # msg type 'open-edx.edx_notifications.lib.tests.test_publisher'
    # to /path/to/{param1}/url/{param2} with param subsitutations
    # that are passed in with the message
    'open-edx.edx_notifications.lib.tests.test_publisher': '/path/to/{param1}/url/{param2}',
    'open-edx.edx_notifications.lib.tests.*': '/alternate/path/to/{param1}/url/{param2}',
    'open-edx-edx_notifications.lib.*': '/third/way/to/get/to/{param1}/url/{param2}',
}

# list all known channel providers
NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_PROVIDERS = {
    'durable': {
        'class': 'edx_notifications.channels.durable.BaseDurableNotificationChannel',
        'options': {
            # list out all link resolvers
            'link_resolvers': {
                # right now the only defined resolver is 'type_to_url', which
                # attempts to look up the msg type (key) via
                # matching on the value
                'msg_type_to_url': {
                    'class': 'edx_notifications.channels.link_resolvers.MsgTypeToUrlLinkResolver',
                    'config': {
                        '_click_link': NOTIFICATION_CLICK_LINK_URL_MAPS,
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    # A null channel basically implements the Channel interface, but does not
    # do anything. This is useful for when you want to not dispatch certain notification
    # types.
    'null': {
        'class': 'edx_notifications.channels.null.NullNotificationChannel',
        'options': {}
    }
}

# list all of the mappings of notification types to channel
NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_PROVIDER_TYPE_MAPS = {
    '*': 'durable',  # default global mapping
}
```


Development and Test HTTP Server
--------------------------------

This repository comes with a simple development and test server so that is possible to develop
and test in an isolated environment (i.e. not have to run the LMS in edx-platform). In order to
use the test server, it is recommended that you make a new dedicated Python virtual-environment:

```
virtualenv edxnotifications_env (just do this once)

source edxnotifications_env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r test_requirements.txt

./manage.py syncdb --settings=testserver.settings
./manage.py migrate --settings=testserver.settings

./manage.py runserver --settings=testserver.settings (run the test server)
```

The development server will provide very raw basic login/register functionality in order to
allow for authentication. Overall, the testserver is not meant to be styled, it is merely
to provide a development environment, plus to act as a HTTP server for all automated UI
test frameworks.


Bok-Choy Tests
--------------

Bok-choy tests are present in the directory

```
/testserver/test/acceptance
```

To run these tests just use the following command

```
bash run_bokchoy_tests.sh
```

To run an individual test use the above command with test name at end, for example

```
bash run_bokchoy_tests.sh test_00_show_notification_pane
```

Jasmine Tests
--------------


Before running Jasmine tests you need to install node.js, you can get it from
[here ](http://nodejs.org "get Node.JS from here")

After installing node.js just run the following command, it install all the required software for running jasmine tests.

```
npm install
```

To run the tests in normal mode with coverage enabled use following command

```
gulp test

- or (depending on search paths) -

node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js test
```

To run the tests in debug mode use

```
gulp debug
```

This will start the tests in debug mode, coverage is turned off in debug mode so it will always show coverage of 0/0 in
debug mode


Writing Jasmine Tests

Jasmine tests are present in the directory

```
/edx_notifications/server/web/static/edx_notifications/js/test/spec
```

While creating a new test file make sure that file name ends in _Spec.js

Note: Jasmine checks the presence of js files in the folder mentioned in karma.config.js file, if any new directory
is added in the code, it's path should be added to karma.config
