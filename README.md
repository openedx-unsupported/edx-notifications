Open edX Platform Integration
-----------------------------
* Add desired commit hash (tip of master) from github code repository
    * edx-platform/requirements/github.txt
    * "Our libraries" section
* Add 'edx_notifications' to the list of installed apps, you can put this in OPTIONAL_APPS:
    * common.py
* Add required configuration in your settings file, e.g. common.py:

```

NOTIFICATION_STORE_PROVIDER = {
    "class": "edx_notifications.stores.sql.store_provider.SQLNotificationStoreProvider",
    "options": {
    }
}

# This setting already exists in the LMS, please
# update it
SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
    'djcelery': 'ignore',
    'edx_notifications': 'edx_notifications.stores.sql.migrations',
}

# to prevent run-away queries from happening
MAX_NOTIFICATION_LIST_SIZE = 100

# list all known channel providers
NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_PROVIDERS = {
    'durable': {
        'class': 'edx_notifications.channels.durable.BaseDurableNotificationChannel',
        'options': {}
    }
}

# list all of the mappings of notification types to channel

    '*': 'durable',  # default global mapping
}
```
